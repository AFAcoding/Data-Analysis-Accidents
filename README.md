Mapping the Impact: Data-Driven Insights into Accident Prevention

Introduction
Understanding the factors that contribute to road accidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. This report analyzes various aspects of traffic accidents, including crash types, injury severity, accident timing, lighting conditions, roadway surface conditions, and the role of road defects. By identifying patterns and trends in accident occurrences, this analysis aims to provide data-driven insights that can inform policies and initiatives to enhance road safety.

Analysis of Accident Trends
Among the different types of crashes, turning accidents are the most prevalent, accounting for 30.65% of all recorded incidents. This is followed by angle crashes, which represent 24.96%, and rear-end collisions, which make up 20.07%. Sideswipe accidents account for 9.61%, while pedestrian-related crashes and other types contribute to the remaining percentage. The high incidence of turning and angle crashes suggests that intersections and junctions are particularly vulnerable points in traffic flow, highlighting the need for improved traffic signal coordination, clearer road markings, and greater driver awareness in these areas.

When examining the severity of injuries resulting from crashes, more than half of all accidents, around 56.08%, result in no injury or involve only minor damage that allows vehicles to drive away. However, 43.92% of accidents lead to injuries or require vehicles to be towed due to damage. While fatal accidents make up only 1.86% of total crashes, incapacitating injuries are observed in 38.10% of cases. These figures emphasize the importance of continued efforts to reduce the occurrence of severe crashes, particularly those leading to long-term physical consequences for those involved.

Accident frequency varies significantly depending on the time of day. The data shows that crashes are most likely to occur between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, when traffic volume is at its highest. This period, coinciding with evening rush hours, sees more than 2,000 accidents, while the number of incidents is considerably lower during the early morning hours between midnight and 6:00 AM. The correlation between increased traffic congestion and accident frequency underscores the need for traffic management strategies that can alleviate congestion, such as the optimization of traffic signals, staggered work schedules, and expanded public transportation options.

Lighting conditions also play a crucial role in accident severity. The majority of accidents, approximately 60.68%, occur in daylight, while darkness with lighted roads accounts for 30.74% of fatal crashes. Although fewer accidents occur in complete darkness, dusk, or dawn, these conditions still present risks. Interestingly, the higher percentage of fatal crashes occurring under artificial lighting suggests that while streetlights improve visibility, they do not eliminate the dangers associated with nighttime driving. Enhancing reflective road markings, increasing high-visibility pedestrian crossings, and ensuring that street lighting is adequate and well-maintained could contribute to reducing nighttime accident severity.

The number of vehicles involved in an accident also influences injury severity. The data indicates that two-vehicle crashes contribute to the highest percentage of injuries, while accidents involving three, four, or more vehicles occur less frequently. The predominance of two-vehicle collisions suggests that driver attentiveness, maintaining a safe following distance, and adhering to defensive driving techniques are essential in preventing such incidents.

Another factor influencing accident severity is the condition of the roadway. The analysis reveals that the vast majority of accidents occur on roads that have no recorded defects. Although road defects such as worn surfaces, shoulder damage, rut holes, and debris contribute to a smaller fraction of accidents, maintaining road quality remains an essential aspect of accident prevention. Routine road maintenance and timely repairs can prevent potential hazards and further reduce accident rates.

The condition of the roadway surface also plays a significant role in fatal accidents. The data shows that 79.22% of fatal injuries occur on dry roads, compared to 16.72% on wet roads. Snow, slush, ice, and other surface conditions contribute to a smaller percentage of crashes. These findings suggest that while wet and icy roads are often perceived as dangerous, drivers tend to exercise greater caution under such conditions. In contrast, on dry roads, higher speeds and overconfidence may contribute to a greater number of severe crashes. Increased enforcement of speed limits, road safety awareness campaigns, and infrastructure improvements can help mitigate the risks associated with driving on dry roads.

Conclusion and Recommendations
This analysis highlights several key factors influencing accident occurrences and severity, providing valuable insights into potential preventive measures. The high frequency of turning and angle crashes suggests that improving intersection management, enhancing traffic signal coordination, and increasing driver awareness at junctions could help reduce accident rates. Addressing the risks associated with peak traffic hours through congestion management strategies, such as staggered work schedules and expanded public transportation options, can further contribute to reducing accident frequency.

The impact of lighting conditions on accident severity underscores the need for better nighttime road visibility, including the implementation of reflective road markings and high-visibility pedestrian crossings. Encouraging safe driving habits, particularly on dry roads where fatal crashes are most prevalent, is also critical. Speed awareness campaigns, stricter enforcement of speed limits, and the use of speed monitoring technologies can help mitigate risks.

While road defects do not appear to be a primary cause of accidents, maintaining road quality remains an essential aspect of road safety. Regular road maintenance and timely repairs can help prevent additional hazards that may contribute to accidents. Additionally, promoting defensive driving techniques and ensuring that drivers adhere to safe following distances can help reduce the likelihood of two-vehicle collisions.

By implementing these recommendations, policymakers and transportation authorities can work toward creating safer roads and reducing the incidence of accidents, ultimately improving public safety and reducing the human and economic costs associated with traffic collisions.
